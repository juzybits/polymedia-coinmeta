# Polymedia CoinMeta

CoinMetadata for Sui coins, and web-optimized logos.

![Polymedia CoinMeta](https://coinmeta.polymedia.app/img/open-graph.webp?x1)

### The problem

Sui apps often rely on `CoinMetadata` objects to find coin info like the decimals, ticker, and logo.

While `CoinMetadata` objects can be fetched directly from a Sui RPC, this has drawbacks that can lead to bad UX:
- If the app needs metadata for many coin types, it will make an RPC request for each of them, which is slow.
- The coin logo is often missing from the `CoinMetadata` object.
- The image could be very large, or stored in a slow web server.

### How CoinMeta helps

It provides pre-fetched `CoinMetadata` and web-optimized logos for top Sui coins.

The logos are served from CloudFlare, compressed and resized, so they load quickly in your app.

If your app needs a `CoinMetadata` that's not already pre-fetched, CoinMetaFetcher falls back to `SuiClient.getCoinMetadata()`, and caches the response.

## How to use

```shell
pnpm add @polymedia/suitcase-core
```

```typescript
import { CoinMetaFetcher } from "@polymedia/suitcase-core";

// reuse the same fetcher across your app
const fetcher = new CoinMetaFetcher({ client: suiClient });

// fetch one coin
const coinMeta = await fetcher.getCoinMeta("0x2::sui::SUI");

// fetch multiple coins
const coinMetas = await fetcher.getCoinMetas([ "0x2::sui::SUI", "0x123::coin::COIN" ]);
```

## Web: [src/web](./src/web/)

The https://coinmeta.polymedia.app webapp, hosted on CloudFlare.

\- It serves the coin logos, optimized for the web, e.g. [`/img/coins/0x30a6â€¦SPAM.webp`](https://coinmeta.polymedia.app/img/coins/0x30a644c3485ee9b604f52165668895092191fcaf5489a846afa7fc11cdb9b24a-spam-SPAM.webp)<br/>
\- It serves the full list of pre-fetched `CoinMetadata<T>` via [`/api/data.json`](https://coinmeta.polymedia.app/api/data.json)

## CLI: [src/cli](./src/cli/)

Command line tools to fetch `CoinMetadata<T>` objects and coin logo images.

### `pnpm cli:fetch-raw`

Downloads the `CoinMetadata<T>` objects and the coin logos for all coins in [./data/manual-input.json](./data/manual-input.json)

### `pnpm cli:make-prod`

Transforms the output of the previous script into production-ready images (compressed and resized) and updates `api/data.json`.
